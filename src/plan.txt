Goal assignement is handled by rooms

Goals prioritize a certian creep role, but will still be assigned to creeps of a less optimal role

In the case that a creep of an optimal role becomes available, and searches for a job, 
that creep will override the job of the creep of a suboptimal role;

Goals determine jobs which lead to a collective outcome;
