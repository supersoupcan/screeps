screeps
=======

## Intent 

Practise javascript development processes
Place an intial start, and have the rest go automatically, although we will probally have to make comprimises along the way as we approach that level of functionality.

## Design Philosophy

Use grunt-screeps to push git versions to screeps game folder

Extend every Game Object with our own methods and our own Objects
Document use of our own Constructors
Use Memory and CPU liberally during initial development
Utilize the revealing prototype pattern
Use GitHub branches for adding experimental features
Push to GitHub at the end of every work session
Test extensively in Game before merging experimental branches

## Key Features
Dynamically reasses jobs based on goal priority
Creep body ratios and jobs determined by role


## TO DO

A lot
